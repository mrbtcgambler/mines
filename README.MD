**Mines Game Simulation**

**Overview**

This project simulates the **Mines** game, commonly found in online casinos, over multiple rounds. The purpose is to test different betting strategies and understand the inherent risks associated with gambling. By analyzing the outcomes, we aim to educate users about the real dangers of gambling and discourage irresponsible behavior.

**Features**

-   Simulate millions of Mines game rounds.
-   Customize betting strategies and game parameters.
-   Analyze outcomes to understand risks.
-   Educational tool to discourage gambling.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** (Version 12 or higher)
-   **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor of your choice)

**Installation**

**1. Signup to play Mines  
**Visit the [official website](https://stake.com/?c=4348ca4a)

**2. Download and Install Node.js**

Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation prompts.

**3. Download and Install Visual Studio Code**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation prompts.

**4. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mines-game-simulation.git

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

**5. Navigate to the Project Directory**

bash

Copy code

cd mines-game-simulation

**6. Install Dependencies**

Install the required npm packages by running:

bash

Copy code

npm install crypto

**Note:** The crypto module is a built-in Node.js module. If you encounter issues, ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version.

**Running the Simulation**

You can run the simulation script using Node.js:

bash

Copy code

node mines-simulation.js

\*\*Replace mines-simulation.js with the actual filename if different.

**Configuration**

The simulation can be customized by modifying the variables at the beginning of the script. Open the script in Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.

**Key Configuration Variables:**

-   **Balance and Betting:**
    -   balance: Starting balance for the simulation.
    -   baseBet: Base bet amount for each round.
    -   increaseOnLoss: Multiplier applied to the bet after a loss.
-   **Game Parameters:**
    -   numberOfMines: Number of mines in the game (e.g., 1-24).
    -   tilesToUncover: Number of tiles the player attempts to uncover before cashing out.
-   **Simulation Settings:**
    -   totalBets: Total number of game rounds to simulate.
    -   vaultThreshold: Profit amount after which funds are moved to the vault.
    -   randomizeAfterBetCount: Number of bets after which the tile selection changes.
-   **Debugging:**
    -   debugMode: Set to true to enable detailed logging.
    -   debugDelay: Delay (in milliseconds) between bets when in debug mode.

**Example:**

javascript

Copy code

// Game Simulation settings

let balance = 1000; // Starting balance

const baseBet = 1; // Base bet amount

let nextBet = baseBet;

const increaseOnLoss = 2; // Double the bet after a loss

const vaultThreshold = 50;

const totalBets = 1000; // Simulate 1,000 game rounds

// Player strategy settings

const numberOfMines = 3;

let tilesToUncover = 2;

const randomizeAfterBetCount = 5;

// Debugging

const debugMode = true;

const debugDelay = 500;

**Understanding the Results**

After running the simulation, the script will display a summary of the outcomes:

-   **Total Bets:** Number of bets placed during the simulation.
-   **Wins/Losses:** Count of winning and losing rounds.
-   **Win Ratio:** Percentage of rounds won.
-   **Final Balance:** Balance after the simulation.
-   **Total Profit:** Total profit made, including vault balance.
-   **Vault Balance:** Profits secured in the vault.
-   **Max Recovery Pot Used:** Maximum amount required to recover from losses.
-   **Largest Bet Placed:** The highest bet amount during the simulation.
-   **Max Win/Loss Streak:** Longest consecutive wins or losses.
-   **Closing Server/Client Seed:** Seeds used in the provably fair algorithm.
-   **Closing Nonce:** Final nonce value after the simulation.
